## Developed By
- Ryan Mackintosh

## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of a database system for the FIFA Women's World Cup. It demonstrates advanced SQL features, such as stored procedures and triggers, and includes a Python interface for database connectivity.

## Repository Structure
- **Data/**: Contains CSV files with match and event data.
- **ERModelling/**: Entity-Relationship (ER) model files.
- **Program/**: SQL scripts and Python programs for database operations.
- **Documentation/**: Detailed project documentation and images.

## Features
- **ER Modeling**: Detailed ER diagrams representing the database structure.
- **Relational Schema**: Normalized tables with primary and foreign keys.
- **Data Description**: Definitions for each attribute with constraints.
- **Database Implementation**: MySQL implementation with integrity constraints.
- **Queries**: Basic and advanced SQL queries for data retrieval.
- **Advanced Database Features**: Stored procedures, views, and indexes for enhanced capabilities.
- **Programming Language Interface**: Python scripts for database operations.

## Part 1: Database Design
- **ER Diagram**: Visual representation of entities, relationships, and constraints.
- **Relational Schema**: Conversion of the ER model to a relational schema.

## Part 2: Database Implementation
- **MySQL Database**: Creation of `fifa_womens_world_cup_21171466` database.
- **Sample Data Loading**: Insertion of data with integrity enforcement.

## Part 3: Queries
- **Basic Queries**: Data retrieval using SQL SELECT statements.
- **Advanced Queries**: Complex queries using joins, sub-queries, and aggregate functions.

## Part 4: Advanced Database Features
- **Stored Procedures**: Encapsulation of complex SQL queries.
- **Views**: Simplification of complex queries.
- **Indexes**: Improvement of record retrieval speed.

## Part 5: Programming Language Interface
- **Python3 Environment**: Execution of queries and database operations.

## User Guide
- **Installation**: Instructions for setting up the database and running Python scripts.
- **Usage**: Guide to using the menu-driven Python interface for database operations.

## Reflection
- **Documentation**: Reflection on design decisions, challenges, and improvement suggestions.

## Setup and Usage
